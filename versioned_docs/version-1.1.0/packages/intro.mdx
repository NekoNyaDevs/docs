# Introduction

We made some API clients in several languages to make it easier for you to use our API. You can find them on our GitHub repository.

## What is an API client?

An API client is a library that allows you to interact with an API. It makes it easier to make requests and handle responses.

## Why use an API client?

Using an API client is easier than making requests manually. It handles the requests and responses for you, so you can focus on what you want to do with the data.

## Our API clients

Here is a list of our API clients:

- [JavaScript](/docs/packages/js)
- [Java](/docs/packages/java) (outdated)

If you want to contribute to our API clients, you can do so by submitting a pull request on our GitHub repository. We will be happy to review your changes and merge them if they are good.
