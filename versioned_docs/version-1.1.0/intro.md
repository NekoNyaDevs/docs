# Introduction

Welcome to NekoNya's documentation. This documentation covers the NekoNya API and several client (what we call "packages").

The documentation is available on GitHub, and you can contribute to it by submitting a pull request.

## What is NekoNya?

NekoNya was originally made by TheDogHusky, as a small useless project about anime and nekos. However, he kept developing it and want it to become a big website about anime and nekos.

Now, the website is open-source and maintained by NekoNyaDevs, a small group of developers that want to make the website better and better.

Our goal is to make the website the best utility anime and neko themed website, with an API and some other cool features.
