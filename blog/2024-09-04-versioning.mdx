In this blog post I will explain how I manage the versioning of my projects. I will also explain how I use the versioning in my projects.

<!-- truncate -->
The version string is always made of **major**.**patch**.**minor** (ex: 2.1.5).
Versioning in most of my projects works the following way:

## Major
They are marked as the first number in the version string. They often indicate a **breaking change**, and would probably need you to update your application to make this change.

For a website, I would update this on a complete rewrite of the application (like going from an ExpressJS JavaScript project to an ExpressJS TypeScript project, or to a NuxtJS TypeScript project, with a frontend and backend, best example of this is with [NekoNya](https://nekonya.classydev.fr)).

## Minor

They are marked as the last number in the version string. They are **changes**, not really bug fixes. Bug fixes are on the patch/fix section.
They essentially are changes that doesn't affect the application/project, aren't breaking changes.

What I **don’t** consider a minor update, and becomes un-versioned:
- A minor update that doesn’t affect the experience that much
- A minor bug fix (ex: typo, or little error\*)
- Anything that does makes a big change or at least medium change to the website

\*: *this is different accross projects. I wouldn't ignore a bug fix in a package and would put it out as a patch/fix but I would in a website.*

## Patch/Fix

They are marked as the second number in the version string.
As their name says, they are patches or bug fixes.
They can sometimes affect the behavior of the application.

In a website I would only update this number if this is a major bug fix.
On a package or other project, I would usually increase the number for small bug fixes to big bug fixes.

## Conclusion

I hope this blog post helped you understand how I manage the versioning of my projects. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DUnuSfFdEM) or my contact email. I will be happy to answer your questions.
